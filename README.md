AI powered sustainability (ESG) assessment for the Real Estate industry, REthink.AI

## Summary

Artificial Intelligence powered sustainability assessment will revolutionize how ESG analysis is performed in the real estate industry. An AI enhanced sustainability assessment process is able to capture significantly more information with a higher accuracy and less human interference, and with more prudent cost and time efficiency.

## Background

The cost and time required in the real estate industry to obtain sustainability certifications varies globally. However, it is universally expensive and time consuming. The LEED ceritificate in the US costs in total USD 55,000 - 130,000 and the DGNB certificate in Europe costs between EUR 65,000 and 185,000. The time required to obtain ESG ceritificates is approximately 3 months in the US and 2-6 months in Europe. Ironically, rather than advancing sustainability, the cost and long time to perform these programs can have the unintended effect of actually discouraging more widespread use of sustainability assessments in the real estate industry. Substituting the manual assessment process with machine learning tools can dramatically decrease the cost and time of Real Estate sustainability assessments, including ESA (Environmental Site Assessments) as an example in commercial real estate mortage lending process, all while improving the accuracy of the assessment process. Real estate developers and investors allocating their investments in a portfolio of properties are able to optimize their property holdings in accordance to the global sustainability benchmarks.

## How is it used?

REthink.AI can be used by appraisal consultants, commercial real estate credit institutions, insurance companies, sustainability consultants, ESG investors and home buyers conserned about sustainability issues. Real estate developers are able to use REthink.AI analysis as certified assessments to apply for credit and for marketing purposes. REthink.AI enables users to do sustainability and environmental assessments in real time on commercial real estate and multifamily buildings. All properties are given individual sustainability rankings in comparison to the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark and in relation to local and regional properties in the same sub-sector.

## Data sources and AI methods

REthink.AI uses all local and federal governmental documents and correspondency, all property related documents published by the developer(s), property and company related financial documents and records. Optical character recognition (OCR) is used to automatically read through data from all necessary documents.

Regression analysis is used for sustainability benchmark optimization. Cluster analysis is used for risk analytics purposes to inform the user of their risk exposures.
Property utility efficiency data is processed by the REthink.AI and compared to other similar properties through the nearest neighbour process. Data is processed by neural network and reported either in standardized model or customized upon client needs.
